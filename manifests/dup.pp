# Run duplicity-backup as part of a backupninja run.
#
# Valid attributes for this type are:
#
#   order:
#
#      The prefix to give to the handler config filename, to set order in
#      which the actions are executed during the backup run.
#
#   ensure:
#
#      Allows you to delete an entry if you don't want it any more (but be
#      sure to keep the configdir, name, and order the same, so that we can
#      find the correct file to remove).
#
#   options, nicelevel, testconnect, tmpdir, sign, encryptkey, signkey,
#   password, include, exclude, vsinclude, incremental, keep, bandwidthlimit,
#   sshoptions, destdir, desthost, desuser:
#
#      As defined in the backupninja documentation.  The options will be
#      placed in the correct sections automatically.  The include and
#      exclude options should be given as arrays if you want to specify
#      multiple directories.
#
#   directory, ssh_dir_manage, ssh_dir, authorized_keys_file, installuser,
#   installkey, backuptag:
#
#      Options for the bakupninja::server::sandbox define, check that
#      definition for more info.
#
# Some notes about this handler:
#
#   - When specifying a password, be sure to enclose it in single quotes,
#     this is particularly important if you have any special characters, such
#     as a $ which puppet will attempt to interpret resulting in a different
#     password placed in the file than you expect!
#   - There's no support for a 'local' type in backupninja's duplicity
#     handler on version 0.9.6-4, which is the version available in stable and
#     testing debian repositories by the time of this writing.
